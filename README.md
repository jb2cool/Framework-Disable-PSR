# Framework-Disable-PSR
Small script for disable Panel Self Refresh on a Framework laptop running Linux Mint to prevent screen freezing.

This should be as simple to use as:
```
wget https://github.com/jb2cool/Framework-Disable-PSR/raw/refs/heads/main/disable-psr.sh
bash disable-psr.sh 
```

Information about this fix came from [here](https://community.frame.work/t/ryzen-ai-linux-mint-22-cinnamon-freezing-after-july-31st-package-updates/73948/17).
